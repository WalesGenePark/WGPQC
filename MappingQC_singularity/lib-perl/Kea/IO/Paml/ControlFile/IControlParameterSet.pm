# indicated by branch lengths calculated from the two rates may be interesting

# programs such as neighbor without any change.  Otherwise you need to edit the

# "clock specifies models concerning rate constancy or variation among lineages.
# clock = 0 means no clock and rates are entirely free to vary from branch to
# branch.  An unrooted tree should be used under this model.  For clock = 1, 2,

# all branches having the same rate.  If fossil calibration information is
# specified in the tree file using the symbol @, the absolute rate will be
# calculated.  Multiple calibration points can be specified this way. If
# sequences have dates, this option will fit Andrew Rambaut’s TipDate model.
# clock = 2 implements local clock models of Yoder and Yang (2000) and Yang and
# Yoder (2003), which assume that branches on the tree can be partitioned into
# several rate groups.  The default is group 0, while all other groups have to
# be labeled using branch/node labels (symbols # and $) in the tree.  The
# program will then estimate those rates for branch groups.  clock = 3 is for
# combined analysis of multiple-gene or multiple-partition data, allowing the
# branch rates to vary in different ways among the data partitions (Yang and
# Yoder 2003).  To account for differences in the evolutionary process among
# data partitions, you have to use the option G in the sequence file as well as
# the control variable Mgene in the control file (baseml.ctl or codeml.ctl).
# Read the section above on “Tree file format” about how to specify fossil
# calibration information in the tree, how to label branch groups.  Read
# Yang and Yoder (2003) and the readme file in the examples/MouseLemurs/

# method, and are not always reliable. Even if this approximation is reliable,
# tests relying on the SE's should be taken with caution, as such tests rely on

# each codon (amino acid) site. The first is for the best codon. The second, in
# parentheses, is for the most likely amino acid under the codon substitution
# model. This is a sum of posterior probabilities across synonymous codons.  In
# theory it is possible although rare for the most likely amino acid not to

# there are multiple local optima.  Use 1 if you want to use the branch lengths
# as initial values for the ML iteration.  Try to avoid using the “branch
# lengths” from a parsimony analysis from PAUP, as those are numbers of changes
# for the entire sequence (rather than per site) and are very poor initial
# values. Use 2 if you want the branch lengths to be fixed at those given in the
# tree file (rather than estimating them by ML).  In this case, you should make
